Technion's Computational Physics Class Winter Semester 2015
Course Number: 118094

This repository contains code that I've written for the Technion Physics Department Computational Physics course in Winter Semester 2015. 
I was not registered full time in this course and did some of the exercises when I felt like playing around with the questions. 
I do not promise bug free at any point. Enjoy.
